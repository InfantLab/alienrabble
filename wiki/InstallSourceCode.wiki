= Installing the source code =

This document should talk you through the steps necessary to run the project from source code. These instructions are for working with the Eclipse IDE, a very powerful development platform for java and other languages that runs on all operating systems. It's completely free too. (In principle, it should  be easy to use other platforms too.)

= Pre-requisites =

  # Install [ Eclipse]. 
  # Install [ Subclipse]- an svn tool for eclipse. This allows you to check out code from online repositories such as code.google.com
  # Install jme2 from jMonkeyEngine - the game development toolkit that Alien Rabble is built with.
