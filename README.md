#summary Alien Rabble: A 3D category learning task for young children.

= Introduction =

Alien Rabble was a psychology experiment disguised as a simple 3D computer game. It designed for testing category learning in young children. It features two tasks, a collecting game where participants must drive a vehicle around a 3D environment grabbing 'good' aliens and avoiding 'bad' ones. The aim is for them to learn the diffference. A second task involves sorting aliens into families.

It was developed by Caspar Addyman as part of his PhD at the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London. The scientific aims of the project are described in Chapter five:

= Using the code =

It was built with an old version of jMonkeyEngine games engine. It would be unlikely to work without substantial revision. The code is here mainly for posterity :)
